Hackbright Academy Capstone Project

The Inspiration: 
In 2006, Netflix announced an open competition for the best <em>collaborative filtering algorithm</em> to predict user ratings for films based solely on previous ratings. Netflix provided a dataset of 480,189 users, 17,770 movies, and 100,480,507 ratings. 

The Challenge: 
How does one calculate predicted ratings for each (movie, user) pair from a very sparse seed dataset? 

The Solution: 
Neighborhood-based Matrix Decomposition
